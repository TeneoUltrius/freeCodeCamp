    <h2>What iPhone was there in 2007?</h2>
    <p>The iPhone (also known as the iPhone 2G, iPhone 1) is the first smartphone designed and marketed by Apple Inc. After years of rumors and speculation, it was officially announced on January 9, 2007. It combined mobile phone, Internet communications, iPod and other functionalities. The original iPhone introduced a multi-touch interface (control of the functions by dragging finger across the glass display).</p>
    <h2>How did Steve Jobs present the iPhone?</h2>
    <p>Jobs took the stage at the Macworld Conference at Moscone West in San Francisco to announce the iPhone, touting that it was a “widescreen iPod with touch controls,” a “revolutionary mobile phone,” and a “breakthrough Internet communicator.”</p>
    <h2>How much did an iPhone cost in 2007?</h2>
    <p>The device, which didn't actually go on sale until June, started at $499 for a 4GB model, $599 for the 8GB version (with a two-year contract).</p>
    <h2>Does the original iPhone still work?</h2>
    <p>Apple has discontinued the original iPhone, and it can no longer support updated operating systems. But it appears some people don't like change (or spending hundreds of dollars a year for a new phone). As of 2015, about 0.1% of iPhone users still used the original or second model.</p>
